To run unit tests you will need to `pip install pytest`.

To build the documentation you will need to install `mkdocs` and associated packages:

`pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material mkdocstrings[python]`

Then from within your project directory, you can run `mkdocs serve` to start a local HTTP server hosting your copy of the docs. For more information see https://www.mkdocs.org/.
